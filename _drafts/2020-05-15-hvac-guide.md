The Cooperative will be transitioning to cooling the week of April 6, 2020. 
The transition process takes several days and is expected to be completed no later than April 11, 2020.
During the transition the following events will occur:

1. The convector system is driven by a closed loop of water that runs throughout the building.
During the winter, this water is heated by our boilers and used to transfer heat throughout the building. 
At this time, the boiler will be disconnected and the water is allowed to cool by transferring the residual heat to the building.
This ensures that hot water is not passed through the cold AC chiller system.
This process typically takes several days for the latent heat of the system to dissipate. 

2. Once the water reaches the correct operating temperature it is then passed through the chiller system.
This system cools the water to a lower temperature, which is then passed throughout the building. 
Unit convectors are used to absorb the heat from within our Units, transfer it to the water, then exhaust the heat out of the building using the chiller system on the roof.

3. Convectors are typically cleaned and filters changed at this time
However, due to the COVID-19 pandemic this service is delayed until a later date.
This will avoid having the Building Engineers entering all Units and potentially exposing themselves or the Cooperative to an increased risk of infection.

Building engineer will contact shareholders to schedule a convector service date. Units will be serviced at a reduced frequency over the next several weeks. 

Any shareholder is free to request that service will be skipped. In this case your unit will be tracked and serviced at a later date. This increases chance of damage and requires sharehodlers to pay extra attention. 

If a shareholder is sick/unwell or has any other complication, inform the Building engineer directly and your unit will be skipped. 


## Important Information

However, due to the modified service it is critical that all shareholders pay extra attention and take the following steps:

1. Pay extra attention to any leaks or water visible near the convectors. 
This is a sign of a serious leak and MUST be communicated immediately to the Building Engineer, Roost, and the Board. 
Any delay will cause serious damage and disruption to the entire Cooperative. 
This is not the time to ignore leaks or issues. 
It is your responsibility as a shareholder to protect the Cooperative infrastructure.

2. All convectors are equipped with water alarms. 
DO NOT interfere with these alarms. 
Notify the Building Engineer, Roost, and the Board immediately if any alarm sounds or you notice water leakage.

3. During this process, the Cooperative will not have any heat until the fall. 
As a result, if one forgets to close the windows during a chilly night it will take a significant amount of time (and sun) to warm your Unit back up.
