This guide serves to describe the process used by the Real Estate Committee in its decision process for the approval of new Shareholders. 
The most critical components are a review of the Shareholder application and the Shareholder interview. 

The goal of the shareholder interview is for the Real Estate Committee and the Board of Directors to meet any potential shareholder and ensure the continued health and good order of the Cooperative and community. The Real Estate Committee uses the interview to explain the structure of the Cooperative and verify that the potential shareholder will be a welcome addition to the community. The Committee has a critical responsibility to ensure that new shareholders will be a welcome addition. This is both a financial as well as personal partnership with any potential Shareholder.
