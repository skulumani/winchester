On May 7, 2019, the Winchester Underwood experienced an extended power outage. 
While the building has been experiencing intermittent electrical issues over the last month, the root cause for this issues was not discovered until 7 May. 
Due to the aging electrical connection to the building there was a large electrical short within the main electrical supply cables serving our building. 
As a result, this electrical fault caused damage to the supply cables which run from the utility pole to our building.
Pepco arrived on scene late on May 7 and began working to repair the supply.
This work was ultimately completed on May 9 with our building gaining upgrading supply lines and an up-to-date electrical supply.
Below is some more detail on the events and commendations for the people/organizations that supported our community.
