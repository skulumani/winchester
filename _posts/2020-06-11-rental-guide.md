The Winchester Underwood Cooperative is a housing Cooperative to provide homes for the Shareholders of the Cooperative. In order to maintain our status as a housing cooperative and receive numerous tax and financial benefits, the Cooperative must maintain a minimum number of Shareholder occupied units. However, the Board understands that situations arise where it is beneficial to rent out a Unit. 

Any Shareholder wishing to rent their Unit must abide by all Cooperative governing documents, including but not limited to the Bylaws, House Rules, Proprietary Lease and Articles of Incorporation. In addition, each Shareholder must accomplish the following items and provide proof of completion prior to Board approval. Upon completion and signature by the Board, this document serves as proof of Board approval for the duration of the lease term. Approval is required for each lease term.
