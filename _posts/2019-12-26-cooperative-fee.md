## Reminder

The Board of Winchester-Underwood considered the 2020 budget carefully and has implemented a new budget and fee increase.
The increase reflects routine increases in some line items, the continued need to replenish association reserves, and the cost of living adjustment.

If you pay through the online portal, please take a minute to log in and confirm that either "pay full balance" is selected on any auto payment or update the set amount to the new fees for your January auto payment to avoid any issues.
