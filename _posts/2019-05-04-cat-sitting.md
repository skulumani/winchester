Travelling with cats at home is a stressful time.
Our community is starting a cat sitting group to help organize neighbors to watch your pets while away.

This is a great opportunity to meet other neighbors and meet some of the cats in the building.
If you'd like to join, visit our Riot room by clicking below and introducing yourself.
