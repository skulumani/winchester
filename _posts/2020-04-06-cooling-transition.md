The Cooperative will be transitioning to cooling the week of April 6, 2020. 
The transition process takes several days and is expected to be completed no later than April 11, 2020.
During the transition the following events will occur:

1. The convector system is driven by a closed loop of refrigerant, which is primarily water. 
During the winter, this refrigerant is heated by our boilers and used to transfer heat throughout the building. 
At this time, the boiler will be disconnected and the refrigerant is allowed to cool.
This ensures that hot refrigerant is not passed through the cold AC chiller system.
This process typically takes several days for the latent heat of the system to dissipate. 

2. Once the refrigerant reaches the correct operating temperature it is then passed through the chiller system.
This system cools the refrigerant to a lower temperature, which is then passed throughout the building. 
Unit convectors are used to absorb the heat from within our Units, transfer it to the refrigerant, then exhaust the heat out of the building.

3. Convectors are typically cleaned and filters changed at this time
However, due to the COVID-19 pandemic this service is delayed until a later date.
This will avoid having the Building Engineers entering all Units and potentially exposing themselves or the Cooperative to an increased risk of infection.

## Important Information

However, due to the modified service it is critical that all shareholders pay extra attention and take the following steps:

1. Pay extra attention to any leaks or water visible near the convectors. 
This is a sign of a serious leak and MUST be communicated immediately to the Building Engineer, Roost, and the Board. 
Any delay will cause serious damage and disruption to the entire Cooperative. 
This is not the time to ignore leaks or issues. 
It is your responsibility as a shareholder to protect the Cooperative infrastructure.

2. All convectors are equipped with water alarms. 
DO NOT interfere with these alarms. 
Notify the Building Engineer, Roost, and the Board immediately if any alarm sounds.

3. During this process, the Cooperative will not have any heat until the fall. 
As a result, if one forgets to close the windows during a chilly night it will take a significant amount of time (and sun) to warm your Unit back up.
