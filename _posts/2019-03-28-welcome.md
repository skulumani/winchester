This is the start of an online website with useful information for the Winchester Underwood Cooperative.

The website is completely free and open for anyone to edit and improve.

We'll use this space to:

* Improve communication 
* Ensure information and documents are available for all shareholders
* Help share information from the community


To start here is some important information:

1. [EJF Portal](https://portal.ejfrealestate.com) - Online payments and maintenance requests

    You can also call EJF at 202-537-1801

2. [Community Calendar](https://calendar.google.com/calendar/embed?src=ddoo8dlc241cqau8dbegusoan0%40group.calendar.google.com&ctz=America%2FNew_York) - An online Google Calendar showing upcoming community events

3. [Discussion Forum](https://riot.im/app/#/group/+wuc:matrix.org) - An online forum to allow us to quickly communicate.
