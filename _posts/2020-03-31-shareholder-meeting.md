Thanks to all that we're able to join in the virtual shareholders meeting. 
We will plan on holding these virtual meetings on a monthly basis for the foreseeable future as we all work together through the COVID-19 pandemic. 
You can find the [slides](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1MRvCovWK7vGPMPPDhdbXyVLGTT7fTgEW13Ukj0tLT9U/edit?usp=sharing) below. 

In addition, while we had a sizeable turnout of approximately 20 shareholders, this is still a small fraction of our Cooperative. 
Let's all try to work together to encourage our neighbors to join as well.
