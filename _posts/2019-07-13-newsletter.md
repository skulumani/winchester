Thanks to a great suggestion during our last shareholder meeting we are restarting our community newsletter. We hope to distribute these on a regular basis. If you're interested in contributing material or leading the development of the newsletter please feel free to contact the Board. 

# Cooperative Status

The Board of Directors continues the process of transitioning to a new management company. We are currently revising the proposed contract with Roost-DC. They are an employee-owned management company located in the District. We are hopeful they can help to manage and improve our community. Once the contract is finalized and signed we will set up a number of informational meetings with shareholders to explain the new company, management website, and payment process. Look for more information soon!

# Community Events

There are number of exciting events coming up:

1. The Smithsonian will be displaying a full scale projection of the Saturn V used to land Apollo 11 on the Moon onto the east face of the Washington Monument.
