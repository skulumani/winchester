### Introduction

The Winchester-Underwood Cooperative, Inc. (the “Cooperative”) was organized for the purpose of operating and managing an apartment building under the cooperative form of ownership in the interest and for the housing of its members and other lawful occupants.
The responsibility for conducting the affairs of the Cooperative is vested in the Board of Directors, which consists of five shareholders who are elected at the annual meetings of the Cooperative and who serve without compensation.

The Board recognizes that cooperative apartment living requires certain minimum guidelines to regulate the care and use of community facilities and to promote the comfort and well being of all residents.
The Bylaws give the Board authority to adopt rules and regulations to govern the affairs and operation of the building. Violations of these House Rules may result in fines or other sanctions by the Board.
