In order to help improve the timeliness and ease of communication within our community we have setup a new tool.
[Riot](https://about.riot.im/) is a free, secure, and open source communication tool. 
It provides a rich and modern platform to all communication across devices and platforms. 
In fact, Riot is now being developed to provide a secure communication tool for the entire [French Government](https://matrix.org/blog/2018/04/26/matrix-and-riot-confirmed-as-the-basis-for-frances-secure-instant-messenger-app/).

This page serves as a basic guide to get started with the tool and being communicating with the community.

# Account Setup

To begin, you will need to setup a user account. 
This will serve as your account across any devices you use.

Visit [https://riot.im/app/](https://riot.im/app/) and you should see the following:

![app_start]({{ '/images/riot/app_start.png' | absolute_url }}){: .align-center}

Click "Create Account" to see the following screen:

![create_account]({{ '/images/riot/create_account.png' | absolute_url }}){: .align-center}

You can then chose a username, which is how you will be represented within Riot, and a password. 
Ensure you remember the password for use on all of your devices. 

If you would like to receive additional email notifications you can also enter your email address.
However, this is not required but it helpful and allows you to optionally login with your email instead of username.


![user_creation]({{ '/images/riot/user_creation.png' | absolute_url }}){: .align-center}

Once entered you can click "Register".
Accept any Terms and Conditions and you will eventually be online inside Riot.

![initial_screen]({{ '/images/riot/initial_screen.png' | absolute_url }}){: .align-center}

# Terminology

Riot is an online communication tool.
It allows one to easily share text, images, video, and make conference audio/video calls with any number of people. 
Here are some useful definitions to keep in mind:

* Users - Each individual on Riot is identified by their username, for example `@username:matrix.org`.
    * For example, I can be found on Riot as [`@shanks:matrix.org`](https://riot.im/app/#/user/@shanks:matrix.org)
    * All username identifiers begin with `@<username>:<hostserver>` where for our cases `<hostserver>` is replaced with `matrix.org`. 
* Rooms - Rooms are places where multiple people/users have conversations. 
    You can create as many rooms as you'd like for any purpose. 
    Within each room you have the ability to change many settings, such as who has access or invite others.
    Our community already has several rooms which allows us to organize our discussions and help to better control the amount of notifications you receive. You can chose to join any or all of the rooms below
    * All rooms are identified as `#<room_name>:<hostserver>`, for example here is our main community room [`#wuc-community:matrix.org`](https://riot.im/app/#/room/#wuc-community:matrix.org). Simply click the "Join the Discussion" button in the bottom right to begin!

![wuc-community]({{ '/images/riot/wuc-community.png' | absolute_url }}){: .align-center}

* Communities - A feature to allow the organization of several related rooms. This lets us create a main landing page and associate several rooms together for easy access.
    * All communities are identified as`+<community_name>:<hostserver>`, for example our community is [`+wuc:matrix.org`](https://riot.im/app/#/group/+wuc:matrix.org). Here you can see all of our rooms that we've started. Again you can join by simply clicking the "Join this Community" button in the upper right.

![wuc-main]({{ '/images/riot/wuc-main.png' | absolute_url }}){: .align-center}

Remember:

* `@` is used for users
* `#` is used for rooms
* `+` is used for communities

# Additional Applications

There are many other applications for most devices, and of course the website for those who do not wish to install any application.

# Going Forward

This is a new tool and experience for all of us.
There will be many hurdles and obstacles as we all learn to use Riot.
In addition, as we work together we will surely discover areas for improvement.
Hopefully, Riot will being to serve as a useful tool to our community.
