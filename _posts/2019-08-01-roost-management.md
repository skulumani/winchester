The Board is happy to announce that we are moving management companies!
We have signed with [Roost DC](https://www.roost-dc.com/){:target="_blank"} to serve as our new management company.
Roost DC is a local, employee owned management company focused solely on cooperatives/condominiums in the District. 

# Transition Process

We will work throughout the month of August to transition our finances over to Roost. 
On September 1, 2019 we will start solely with Roost as our new management company. 
This page will list all the critical information we need during this process. 
We will most likely experience issues during this process but hopefully with clear and timely communication we can quickly resolve any issues. 

# Critical Information

* Any auto-payment to EJF should be terminated ***before September 1***.
