The Board is happy to announce that we are moving management companies!
We have signed with [Roost DC](https://www.roost-dc.com/){:target="_blank"} to serve as our new management company.
Roost DC is a local, employee owned management company focused solely on cooperatives/condominiums in the District. 

# Transition Process

We will work throughout the month of August to transition our finances over to Roost. 
On September 1, 2019 we will start solely with Roost as our new management company. 
This page will list all the critical information we need during this process. 
We will most likely experience issues during this process but hopefully with clear and timely communication we can quickly resolve any issues. 

# Critical Information

* Any auto-payment or direct debit to EJF should be terminated ***before September 1***. 
    You can disable any automatic payments on the [EJF Portal](https://portal.ejfrealestate.com/){:target="_blank"} or through your financial institution (if setup through them).

# Reminders

Throughout this process it is important to quickly report any issues or problems to the Board. 
You can quickly communicate with the Board or entire Community using the options below:

* [wuc-board@googlegroups.com](mailto:wuc-board@googlegroups.com){:target="_blank"} - Email directly to the Board of Directors
