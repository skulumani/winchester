The Board is happy to announce that we are moving management companies!
We have signed with [Roost DC](https://www.roost-dc.com/){:target="_blank"} to serve as our new management company.
Roost DC is a local, employee owned management company focused solely on cooperatives/condominiums in the District. 

Any questions for managment can be directed to Roost:

* [Owner Portal](https://roostdcllc.appfolio.com/connect/users/sign_in){:target="_blank"}
* Emily  - [emily@roost-dc.com](mailto:emily@roost-dc.com)
* Phone - 202-986-3088 x 103

# Transition Process

We will work throughout the month of August to transition our finances over to Roost. 
On September 1, 2019 we will start solely with Roost as our new management company. 
This page will list all the critical information we need during this process. 
We will most likely experience issues during this process but hopefully with clear and timely communication we can quickly resolve any issues. 

# Critical Information

* Any auto-payment or direct debit to EJF should be terminated ***before September 1***. 
    You can disable any automatic payments on the [EJF Portal](https://portal.ejfrealestate.com/){:target="_blank"} or through your financial institution (if setup through them).

# Paying Cooperative Fees

Beginning with your September payment, all cooperative fees should be sent to Roost. 
Anything sent to EJF after August 31, 2019 will be transitioned correctly to Roost, but there may be a delay.
The cooperative fees have not changed for 2019. 
Cooperative fees are due by 1 September 2019.

There are several methods to pay the cooperative fees:

1. Use the [owner portal](https://roostdcllc.appfolio.com/connect/users/sign_in){:target="_blank"} to pay with an electronic check or credit card. 
2. Pay in cash at any 7/11, CVS, or ACE Sales. Please contact Roost, at 202-986-3088 x 103, if you would like to use this option. You will receive some additional information and a barcode for use to pay with cash.
3. Pay by check. Mail a check made out to the "Winchester Underwood Cooperative" with your Unit number and mailed to:

Payable To: Winchester Underwood Cooperative

Mailing Address:
~~~
Roost DC 
1508 U Street NW 
Washington DC 20009
~~~

***Ensure you add your Unit number to the check***

A related option is to contact your bank and have your financial institution mail a check on your behalf.
Many financial institutions have a "Pay my bills" function on their online website or through a phone call. 
You will require the mailing address above and the amount of the check and the bank will mail a check.
