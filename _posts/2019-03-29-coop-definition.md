Many people confuse condominiums with cooperatives. 
From a legal and financial perspective there are several important differences.

One definition of a cooperative:

    A multi-unit building where each resident has an interest in the building in the form of a share of stock.
    Additionally, the owner of each share of the cooperative is allowed to occupy a particular unit.

In a condominium, each owner owns their individual unit and a portion of the common areas.
However, in a cooperative building, the coorporation, i.e. the cooperative association, owns the entire building and each resident, or shareholder, owns a share of the coorporation.
The ownership of a share provides certain rights and responsibilities to the shareholder.

Managment and financial decisions are made by all shareholders throught regularly shareholder meetings. 
In addition, the shareholders elect a number of board members which serve to handle daily operations.

A cooperative offers some additional benefits over other home ownership options.
In a cooperative, each shareholder is allowed to deduct a portion of any mortgage or loan interest secured to the building on their individual taxes.
Additionally, shareholders are able to deduct a portion of the real estate taxes.
One important benefit of a cooperative is that there are requirements on the number of owner occupied units.
As a result, there cooperatives have a higher percentage owner occupancy than condominiums.
In addition, there is also typically more engagement by owners in the management of the cooperative.
