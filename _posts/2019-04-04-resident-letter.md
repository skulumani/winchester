In April, we sent a letter to all shareholders. 
You can download a copy of this letter [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1XIAjsblZfyGWN25tJjKOa7vPwEBdU7S6/view?usp=sharing).
Here we summarize the main points of the letter.

There have been several complaints about loud noise and smoking/fumes from the community. 
The [House Rules]({% post_url 2019-03-31-house-rules %}) describe the expectations we hold every shareholder to in the building.
Noise and disturbances to other shareholders are addressed:

## Noise and Other Disturbances

> No loud noises that disturb other residents are permitted in the corridors of common areas at any time.
> Special caution shall be exercised to assure that noise from one unit cannot be heard in another unit between the hours of 10:00pm and 8:00am. 
> Radios, stereos, TVs, musical instruments, etc. shall be located and controlled so as not to annoy other residents at any time. 
> Residents shall take appropriate measures, including floor coverings, to prevent noises and other annoying disturbances to other residents. 
> Except for kitchens and bathrooms, not less than eighty percent of the floor area of each unit must be covered by rugs and pads.
> No resident shall permit objectionable fumes or cooking odors to escape by leaving corridor doors open.
> Residents will be held responsible for the behavior of their guests. Residents and their guests are not permitted to congregate in or around the lobby, on the outside lawn, corridors, or other common areas without the express permission from the Board.

## Smoking in units

You are allowed to smoke in your unit but you are not allowed to smoke in any of the common areas.
This includes the halls, the stairways, the elevators, the garage, the lobby, the laundry room.
We ask that if you are smoking in your apartment that you are also considerate of your neighbors and use your ventilator and windows to draw the smoke outside of the building.

## Consequences for repeat violations

We take the complaints about noise very seriously.
For smoking or noise complaints, violators will receive one verbal warning. 
If violators do not comply we will turn over the matter to our attorneys, and if necessary the police for excessive complaints.
Violators can be fined, and in extreme cases evicted.
We are a cooperative and we are neighbors. 
We share this space.
 There is no reason to tolerate rude or inconsiderate behavior by a few people.

## Further suggestions or complaints

You can contact the Board using our [discussion board](https://riot.im/app/#/group/+wuc:matrix.org). 
We are actively working to improve our community for all shareholders.
