Big thanks to Darin who was able to attend the Brightwood Community association meeting held on February 11, 2020. 
He took some detailed notes which are available below.


## Meeting Notes

The meeting started with guest speaker Mrs. Tameka Young who is a neighbor who is running to win the Mrs. DC pageant which is like Miss Dc except for married people.She is able to found on social media and is the founder of the National Association for Kidpreneurs. She works with kids and youth under 18 to bring their business ideas to life. She was very positive and has a lot of good programs for youth. After she finished MPD began to talk about the recent murder and gang/street crew activity in our neighborhood.

The murder is believed to be due to a beef between the crew near McDonald’s and a crew near Columbia Heights. The police have made a lot of arrests concerning the murder and are building cases against others. The police believe that this incident stems from an incident that occurred January 5th 2020 in Silver Spring near Georgia Ave and Ellsworth.  The crew in our neighborhood operates mostly near the McDonald’s around 13th and Peabody and Fort Stevens Dr. However, Pat, a homeowner from 1300 block of Underwood, says he has observed open drug deals taking place at Fort Stevens Park on Van Buren behind the building.  The officers in attendance promised to follow up and see if activity is indeed taking place there. They are also being proactive by working with DCPS to get youth before they take the wrong path. The outreach coordinator for MPD has said that the mayor has a camera rebate program that we should probably look into for our building to see if we are adequately covered. Overall though, the gang activity is mostly gang against gang. I think we do need to be vigilant but the officers said the problem is being resolved and is not an overwhelming problem.
