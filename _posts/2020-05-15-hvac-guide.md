The Cooperative transitioned from heating to cooling on 15 May 2020. 
This particular spring season has been very challenging for everyone with several days of high temperatures followed by long periods of lower than average temperatures. 
In addition, due to the construction of our building temperatures can vary significantly between Units and among floors.
We appreciate the understanding by all Shareholders as we worked through the transition process. 

## Transition Guide

The Board has put together a [document](https://docs.google.com/document/d/15GifheeCyjAad_orzv6zE0WcUGUexxMiXjMWQUzkYgw/edit?usp=sharing) which describes the operation of the HVAC system of the Winchester Underwood. 
In addition, we describe the decision process that is used to transition between heating and cooling.
We hope it will serve as a useful guide and provide additional insight into the process for all Shareholders.

## Modified convector service

Due to the recent COVID-19 pandemic, the typical convector service schedule has been modified. 
In an effort to both ensure the safety of the Cooperative and limit any additional virus exposure we have adopted a modified process for servicing the Unit convectors. 
It is critical that the convectors are properly serviced to ensure that they are fully operational and to prevent any costly damage to Units or the building. 

1. The Building engineer will directly contact shareholders to schedule a convector service date. 
Convectors will be serviced on a greatly reduced frequency over the next several weeks. 
If a shareholder has specific concerns, or is not comfortable with service, then their Unit will be skipped and serviced at a later date. 
It is also imperative that every Shareholder also notify the Building Engineer if there is any possibility of illness. 

2. All Units will be serviced at a reduced frequency over the next several weeks. 
The goal is to service each convector to ensure proper operation and identify any necessary repairs prior to any serious damage. 
However, we will work with any Shareholder that is not comfortable with any additional entry into their Unit. 
It is important to keep in mind that forgoing service increases the possibility of potential damage. 

## Important Information

Due to the modified service it is critical that all shareholders pay extra attention and take the following steps:

1. Pay extra attention to any leaks or water visible near the convectors. 
This is a sign of a serious leak and MUST be communicated immediately to the Building Engineer, Roost, and the Board. 
Any delay will cause serious damage and disruption to the entire Cooperative. 
This is not the time to ignore leaks or issues. 
It is your responsibility as a Shareholder to protect the Cooperative infrastructure.

2. All convectors are equipped with water alarms. 
DO NOT interfere with these alarms. 
Notify the Building Engineer, Roost, and the Board immediately if any alarm sounds or you notice water leakage.
