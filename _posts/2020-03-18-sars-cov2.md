We're all going to be dealing with this virus for a foreseeable future.
The Cooperative is taking some steps to help limit the spread.
Common areas, including elevator buttons, lobby door handles, and laundry rooms, are wiped with a bleach solution three times per day. 

Ultimately it is up to all of us to limit the spread of this virus because it [primarily spreads through close contact between people.](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/prepare/transmission.html)
 We should all act under the assumption that you are already infected and that others in the community are also infected.
Our goal should be to limit the spread of the virus by limiting close contact between people. 

Furthermore, our community is especially vulnerable because there are [many elderly and other high risk individuals](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/specific-groups/high-risk-complications.html?CDC_AA_refVal=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.cdc.gov%2Fcoronavirus%2F2019-ncov%2Fhigh-risk%2Fhigh-risk-complications.html).
 If someone spreads the virus throughout our building, there is a high probability that another resident will die.
Therefore, please consider taking the following steps:

1. If you are sick, SARS-CoV-2 or otherwise, please do not go into any of the common areas of the building.
You will spread the virus and potentially cause the death of another resident. 

2. If you are elderly or in another high risk category, e.g chronic medical conditions such as heart/lung disease or diabetes, then you should also consider limiting your exposure to public areas. 
It is extremely deadly for these high risk groups.

3. If you are willing/able and would like to volunteer to help any residents in need, please contact the Board at [wuc-board@googlegroups.com](mailto:wuc-board@googlegroups.com).
I'm sure many residents will require some assistance in the coming months for things such as groceries or medication. 

4. Similarly, if you are in need of assistance please contact the Board and we will help as much as possible and connect you with others. 

This is also a good time to setup your devices for our [communication tools]({{ site.base_url }}{% post_url 2019-05-10-riot-help %}). 
We'll be using them in addition to flyers in the lobby for holding our next shareholder's meeting.

We all need to work together and think of the community at large during these times.
All systems and infrastructure of the building will be tested during this period and all supply chains are affected.
Repairs and replacements are already in short supply and we cannot have negligence or damage to the building.
