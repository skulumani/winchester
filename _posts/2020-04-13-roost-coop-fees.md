Please find a useful message from Roost DC on cooperative fees and other financial resources. 

Hi everyone,

As we roll into the middle of the month, we wanted to reach out to everyone in advance of any late fees being applied due to missed payments. We know many are facing job loss or tough financial decisions due to COVID-19 and wanted to share some resources that may be of help at this time:

 

* The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau has provided [guidance](https://www.consumerfinance.gov/about-us/blog/guide-coronavirus-mortgage-relief-options/) on what to do if you can’t pay your mortgage and what options are available as part of the Cares Act signed into law March 27. 

* [Forbes.com](https://www.forbes.com/sites/advisor/2020/03/20/mortgage-relief-tracker-covid-19-relief-for-homeowners-and-renters/#271e5b742f19) is tracking what private mortgage companies have articulated relief options, but connecting directly with your mortgage servicer as soon as possible is the best advice at this time. 

Condo fees are critical to the operation of the community, especially during these times when we anticipate some basic expenses to be higher than normal (e.g. water + sewer and any extra cleaning services). Any owner(s) unable to make their monthly payments reach out to us as soon possible regarding options available for payment plans or late fee waiving, all to be approved by the Board of Directors.  You can email the Finance team at [finance@roost-dc.com](mailto:finance@roost-dc.com).  Please make sure your email has your association name/address and unit number when you reach out. 

 

As Roost doesn’t have the authority to waive late fees, they will post, per the Association’s collection policy, with any fees waiver requests to be reviewed by the Board later this month. Some Boards have already agreed to waive all late fees, others will be reviewing as requests come in. We’ll notify homeowners once those decisions have been made. 

 

For those owners who rent their units, our sister company [Nest DC](https://www.nest-dc.com/) has shared the following resources with their clients and we thought it would be helpful to share for the landlords within our portfolio that might have tenants unable to make rent due to COVID-19 related job loss:

 

* DC City Council passed an Emergency Covid-19 Response Bill, which includes measures related to tenant relief - no late fees will be charged and no evictions will be processed for the next 90 days. To find out more click [here](https://dccouncil.us/council-unanimously-passes-emergency-covid-19-response-bill/). 

 

* The CARES Act passed last week by Congress both increased unemployment compensation benefits and added more flexibility to qualify. To find out more click [here](https://coronavirus.dc.gov/recovery-individuals). 
 

* Some taxpayers will be eligible for Economic Impact Payments. To find out more click [here](https://www.irs.gov/newsroom/economic-impact-payments-what-you-need-to-know). 

 

Please reach out if you have any questions. 
 

Be well, 

The Roost DC Team
