Our building experienced another power outage on 22 July, 2019 at approximately 2045 EST.
Thankfully this power outage was significantly shorter in duration than our previous outage in May. 
In addition, this outage did not require any major rework to our infrastructure but did raise additional areas where we can improve our community and emergency procedures. 

# Background Information

Our building has three main power supply "inputs" from the street. 
For a variety of reasons, different parts of the building are supplied by any one of the three possible inputs. 
Having multiple inputs ensures that high draw components, such as the elevator, main boiler, or HVAC systems are not all drawing power from a single line which may overload the system.
In addition, within the building many of the common areas and apartments are all uniquely connected to these three inputs.
For example, the kitchen and dining room may be powered by a different main supply line than the rest of your apartment. 

You may have noticed during power outages parts of the hallway may be illuminated while others are not. 
In addition, any given apartment may lose power while the adjacent apartments have full power. 
This is a common cause of confusion during outages as different parts of the building may have power.

During the power outage of 22 July, one of the three inputs experienced a longer outage of approximately two hours.
The other two inputs only experienced a brief outage that was quickly restored within several seconds.

# Finding information

During this outage there was some confusion as a number of residents called our Building Engineer to report the issue.
In addition, some residents experienced a much longer outage than others further causing confusion.

In the future, one can use any/all of the methods below to quickly communicate with the Board or the Community on building status. 
This allows our Building Engineer to focus on restoring building systems and allows the Board to help quickly disseminate information to residents. 
In addition, one can also check the Pepco outage map below which will quickly show if the issue is localized to our building or a much larger neighborhood problem.
