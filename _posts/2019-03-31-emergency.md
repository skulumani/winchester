It is important for all members of the Cooperative to be aware of the emergency procedures. 
The actions taken during the initial moments of an emergency are critical.
Ensure you know the following:

1. Locations of stairwell exits on your floor and building
2. Location of common area fire alarms

When an emergency occurs, the first priority is life safety.
The second priority is the stabilization of the scene.
The following summarize the emergency procedures for the Cooperative. 
As always in any life threatening emergency (medical or threat of safety) for yourself or others:

1. Call [911](tel:911) immediately

## Fire Emergencies

The Cooperativeâ€™s fire alarm system consists of pull boxes located in the common areas.
If you notice a fire or smoke:

1. Pull the nearest fire alarm
2. If you can exit safely, use the nearest clear stairwell to exit at the ground level. Do NOT use the elevators
3. Once safely out of the building call 911.

*The building's alarm is only a local alarm. The fire department will only arrive with a call to 911*

If a fire occurs inside of your unit, you should:

1. Leave the unit.
2. Close but do NOT lock the door. This will help contain the fire.
3. Pull the nearest fire alarm.
4. Safely exit the building using the stairs
5. Call 911

## Reporting accidents, injuries or fire

Report all accidents, injuries, or fire that occur on the premises:

1. Report to the property managment at [202-537-1801](tel:202-537-1801) 
2. Report to the board at [here](https://riot.im/app/#/room/#wuc-community:matrix.org)

Residents that are involved in or witness an accident, injury or fire that occurs on the Cooperative premises, including on the grounds, must report the accident, injury or fire to the property management company as soon as possible.
Within 24 hours or as soon as reasonably possible, the resident must follow up with a written report to the property management company setting forth the details of the accident or injury so that the information is available for subsequent insurance company investigations.

## Death of a resident

Residents are responsible for providing the property management company with a designated emergency contact.
In the event of the death of a resident within the unit, the Property Manager shall immediately notify local authorities and the emergency contact designated by the resident.
If the designated emergency contact is not available to take immediate responsibility for the apartment and its contents, the property management company may, at its discretion have the unit immediately cleaned and disinfected and may have toxic or contaminated items (included drapes, and furnishings that retain or emit noxious odors) removed from the premises. Depending on the nature and apparent value of items removed from the unit, they will be either disposed of or sealed and temporarily stored pending collection by the family or representatives of a deceased resident.
The Cooperative will not be responsible for contaminated items removed during such emergency cleanup of unit.
